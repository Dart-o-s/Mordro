Orgro is an org-mode file viewer with lots of features for comfortable reading on the go:

- Reflowed text for easy viewing on mobile screens

- Syntax highlighting that faithfully recreates the appearance in Emacs, in both light and dark modes

- Reader mode for hiding extraneous markup and showing only what's important

- Narrow your view to just a single section, just like in Emacs

- Beautiful tables with guaranteed correct spacing, even with non-ASCII characters

- Open external links in your web browser, and section links in narrowed views

- Expand or collapse sections, blocks, and drawers just like in Emacs

Note: INTERNET permission is required for dynamically loading fonts from online sources (Google Fonts, AWS S3).
