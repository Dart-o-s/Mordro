Welcome to Orgro

Orgro is an [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file viewer.

Files open in "overview" visibility mode, with top sections folded.

Tap a section header to expand it ↓

* Supported features

Orgro can understand the following org-mode features:

** Sections

Sections can be opened and closed by touching the section headline.

TODO keywords, priority markers, and tags are highlighted and laid out nicely.

** Blocks

Blocks are laid out with horizontal scroll to keep code readable. They can also
be opened and closed just like sections by touching the block header.

Syntax highlighting is applied for [[https://github.com/git-touch/highlight/tree/master/highlight/lib/languages][many languages]] in =src= blocks.

   #+begin_src bash
     BAR='bar'

     foo() {
       echo "foo $BAR $@"
     }

     if true; then
         foo 'baz'
     fi
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : foo bar baz

The example above also illustrates affiliated keywords (the =#+RESULTS:= line)
and fixed-width areas (the =: foo bar baz= line). Fixed width areas also have
horizontal scroll to ensure proper display.

Hide meta lines like =#+RESULTS:= with [[*Reader Mode][Reader Mode]].

** Tables

Tables are rendered as GUI tables (rather than as raw text) to ensure proper
spacing.

| Foo         |    Bar |  Baz |
|-------------+--------+------|
| Lorem ipsum | 30.000 |    1 |
| 123         |        |      |
| あいうえお  |  -1e24 | >3.5 |

** Lists

List content is shown with content reflowed for easy reading on narrow screens.

- foo
  - [X] bar
  - [ ] baz
    1. buzz
    2. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum ipsum
       sapien, molestie nec posuere at, porta sit amet neque. Duis vulputate
       quis est et vestibulum. Quisque vehicula dolor vestibulum vestibulum
       porta.
  - bazinga
    - thing :: this
    - thang :: that

** Drawers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: foobar
   :END:

Drawers are collapsed by default, but can be opened by touching the header.

** Links

External links open in your web browser:

- Org-style bracketed links [[https://github.com/amake/sponsor][like this]]
- Raw URLs like https://github.com/amake/sponsor

Links to other sections in the same document open in a narrowed view. See [[*Narrowing][Narrowing]].

** Emphasis

The default emphasis markers are supported:

- *bold*
- /italic/
- _underline_
- +strikethrough+
- ~code~
- =verbatim=

Hide the emphasis markers with [[*Reader Mode][Reader Mode]].

** Other

Other syntaxes that are highlighted but not (yet) interpreted in any special
way:

- Timestamps and ranges :: [2020-05-05 Tue]
- Footnotes :: guess what[fn:: this is a footnote]
- Macro references :: {{{date}}}

* Narrowing

Orgro can "narrow" the view to a specific section in two ways:

- Open a section link
- Long touch a section headline

Close the narrowed view by touching the Back button in the top app bar.

* Reader Mode

Enable Reader Mode to hide emphasis markers and meta lines (lines starting with
=#+=). The Reader Mode toggle can be found in one of two places:

- Narrow screens (phones) :: =Reader mode= in the action menu
- Wide screens (tablets) :: icon button in the top app bar

* Visibility Cycling

Rotate sections between expanded and collapsed states just like org-mode in
Emacs:

1. Overview: Show only top-level headlines
2. Contents: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text
3. Show all: Show everything

- Narrow screens (phones) :: =Cycle visibility= in the action menu
- Wide screens (tablets) :: icon button in the top app bar

* Search

Touch the search button in the top app bar and enter a query. Relevant sections
will be expanded, while sections without hits will be collapsed. Hits are
highlighted.

* Text Style

Adjust the text size and font with the button in the top app bar.

* Questions and Feedback

Feel free to raise an issue [[https://github.com/amake/orgro/issues][on GitHub]].
