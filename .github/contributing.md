# How to contribute to Orgro

## Did you find a bug?

Please report it [here](https://github.com/amake/orgro/issues).

Please include as much of the following as possible:

- A description of what you *expected* to happen
- A description of what *actually* happened
- Screenshots
- Information about your environment:
  - What OS (Android, iOS, iPadOS)?
  - What version of the OS?
  - What version of Orgro? (See "About" in the menu on the top-level screen)

## Do you want to contribute a feature or bug fix?

Please open a pull request [here](https://github.com/amake/orgro/pulls).

**Important!** Pull request authors must assign the copyright of their
contributions to the author of Orgro, [@amake](https://github.com/amake). This
is because:

- Orgro is licensed under the GPL-3.0, which is not held to be compatible with
  distribution on platforms that add restrictions, such as the Apple App Store.
- However, @amake owns the copyright of all the GPL-3.0 code that is contained
  within Orgro, so he is able to distribute the code under other terms as well.
- For Orgro to remain distributable on the App Store while still accepting
  outside contributions, the contributions must also be multi-licenseable in
  this way.

### How do I assign copyright for my contribution?

@amake is just a single person developing Orgro as a hobby; he doesn't have a
legal team or even any specialist knowledge in this area.

Thus you just have to check the checkbox in the PR template, and don't sue
@amake or anything like that.

### What if I don't want to assign copyright?

Then sorry but your contribution will not be accepted. You are free to fork
Orgro and share your contribution with the world under the terms of the GPL-3.0
license.
